## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Backend Logic:**
```python
# Season status check in API endpoints
if season_status in ['offseason', 'preseason']:
    return jsonify({
        'success': True,
        'sport': sport_info['name'],
        'games': [],
        'season_status': season_status,
        'season_message': get_season_message(sport_info['name'], season_status),
        'data_source': 'season_status_check'
    })
```

### **Frontend State Management:**
```javascript
const [seasonStatus, setSeasonStatus] = useState(null);
const [seasonMessage, setSeasonMessage] = useState(null);

// Handle season status in API response
if (data.season_status && data.season_status !== 'active') {
  setSeasonStatus(data.season_status);
  setSeasonMessage(data.season_message);
}
```

### **Conditional Rendering:**
```javascript
{!loading && !error && seasonMessage && (
  <SeasonStatusCard className={seasonStatus}>
    <SeasonStatusIcon>
      {seasonStatus === 'offseason' ? <PauseCircle size={48} /> : <Calendar size={48} />}
    </SeasonStatusIcon>
    <SeasonStatusTitle>{seasonMessage.title}</SeasonStatusTitle>
    <SeasonStatusDescription>{seasonMessage.description}</SeasonStatusDescription>
    <SeasonStatusAction>{seasonMessage.action}</SeasonStatusAction>
  </SeasonStatusCard>
